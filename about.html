      <h2 class="about">Founders</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="about">
        <strong>Profero</strong> was born out of a shared passion for music and discovery by four
        close friends: <strong>Omar Nader Nashaat</strong>,
        <strong>Nour Mohamed Fahim</strong>, <strong>Ali Osama Ahmed</strong>,
        and <strong>Adham</strong>. Each brought their own unique tastes and
        perspectives, but they all felt that the existing music discovery
        platforms lacked a way to truly help users connect with fresh, exciting
        music. Together, they set out to build a platform that would not only
        introduce people to new songs, artists, and genres but also make
        discovery feel personal and inspiring. With their combined skills and a
        commitment to bridging listeners with new sounds, they founded Profero.
        Today, it stands as a reflection of their collective dream: a place for
        anyone to find and fall in love with music, one song at a time.
